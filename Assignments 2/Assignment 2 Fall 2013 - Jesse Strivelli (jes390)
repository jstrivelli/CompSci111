Assignment 2 Fall 2013 - Jesse Strivelli (jes390)


/* 
 *	Author: Jesse Strivelli
 * 	Assignment: #2, Problem #1
 *	Suppose that there is a website Quarter.com where you can buy used items (at up to half price!).  The Standard Delivery 
 *	shipping and handling charge is $3.99 per shipment (not per item) plus $0.99 per pound of the shipment.  Customers may 
 *	choose Superfast Delivery instead, for $12.99 per shipment (not per item) plus $4.99 per pound of the shipment. The website 
 *	is running a promotion whereby customers receive free Standard Delivery shipping if they buy more than 10 items.

 *	Ask the user for the number of items they wish to buy (integer) and whether they want Superfast Delivery (boolean: true means Superfast, 
 *	false means Standard), and then the total weight of the shipment in that order. Then compute the total cost of their order (real number).

	Assignment: #2, Problem #2
	You work for the a payment processing service called PayFriend. PayFriend charges money receivers the following fees

	The first $100 has a flat fee of $5.
	Payments over $100 (but under $1000) have a fee of 3% or $6, whichever is higher.
	Payments $1,000 (but under $10,000)  and over have a fee of 1% or $15, whichever is higher.
	Payments $10,000 and over are subject to fees as follows:
	The first $10,000 have a fee of 1%
	The next $5,000 have an additional fee of 2%
	Anything more will demand an additional fee of 3%
	For example, an payment of $40,000 would be subject to $950 fee: 1% on the first $10,000 ($100 fee), 2% on the next $5,000 ($100 fee), and 3% on the last $25,000 ($750 tax).

	Ask the user for their payment amount (integer) and compute the amount of the fee that they owe (real number).

	the number of cans of soda each person should be able to drink
	the cost of a pizza pie
	the number of slices in a pizza pie
